            <h1>My Life as a programer</h1>
            
        </div>
        <p>I started programing at an age of 12 at my school and then at 15 i learnt programing with more interest by WhitHat Junior.
            WhiteHat Junior helped me lot in programing.
            As it is covid - 19 lockdown period i started programing with whiteHat junior in my free time while i play outdoor games, 
            before this i started posting youtube videos about the game <b>Fortnite</b> which i play.
